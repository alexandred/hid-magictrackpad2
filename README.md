magictrackpad2-dkms
===================

DKMS module for apple magic trackpad2 clobbered together from various sources.

Very very alpha.

Does force touch (does not trigger an event at the moment though - coming soon) and supports bluetooth only at the moment.

This is based *heavily* on work by @robbi5 and @robotrovsky. Proper attribution will be added soon. My apologies.

Thanks:
